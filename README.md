I am a recent graduate with a profound interest in technology and a dedication to solving complex problems. My journey in computer science has led me to develop a passion for cybersecurity, and I am now eager to transition into this field, I'm fascinated by the offensive side of cybersecurity — red teaming, reconnaissance, exploiting vulnerabilities — and I’m constantly improving my skills through Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges, ethical hacking labs, and research into emerging threats. I aspire to be a world-class ethical hacker, someone who’s not only technically skilled but also trusted by organizations to solve complex cybersecurity challenges and build resilient defenses.
